	<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>General main components of the site.</u></h1><br>
	<p>Generally speaking, the site's navigation bar will have 5 tabs. These will be...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Home (Containing the landing page. It will have a few pictures of students playing in uniform and / or the school's infrastructure.)</li>
		<li>About (Containing a brief history, mission and vision statements, etc. This is all depepndent on what the school has.)</li>
		<li>Updates (Containing the school's accomplishments, regularly updated news letter, fee structure, and basic statistics of the school (optional))</li>
		<li>Gallery (Images of the schools' choice on showcase)</li>
		<li>Blog (A page containing links to a series of publications by the school. These should be submitted to me via email with instructions on when to publish them.)</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p>The page called "About" needs to be populated by the school. Idealy, a brief history, their core values etc. This is entirely upto them.</p><br>
	<p>The page called updates should be regularly updated with the school's events, both planned and past. </p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<p>The footer section of each page will contain the school logo, a small paragraph from the school, generally about who they are, what they stand for, or a quote. Basically a single statement. It will have a small list of the school's contacts, and location, and it will also contain my email address.</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p>In conclusion. Please send information for the first school so that I can feed it into this template and a few pictures of their uniform for the purpose of the color-scheme. I also need about 5,000/= to lease the relevant services for hosting the site, getting a security certificate, and buying a good domain name which the school will enjoy. All I need right now is just plain- text which I can feed into this code to display prototypes, but once we require to publish the final product, I'll need that 5k for the services. (This 5k is not an exact figure. I will communicate it hopefully within a few days. Also, the 5k is exclusive of my service rates. It is only for the required services for website hosting, publishing and security.) </p><br>
	<p>This first site is basically a letter to you showing briefly what the sites could potentially look like, but hopefully, if you send me the information on the first school, I can have the first site ready in three (3) days to one week of receiving the information.</p>
